      "Hello everyone thank you for coming today. Before we start I want us to check in quickly how we are feeling. Tired. Okay that’s understandable midweek energy. Excited. Good to hear. Nervous. Thank you for sharing. Today we will continue talking about growth mindset and also coping with difficult thoughts when you feel overwhelmed. Sometimes when people face stress they have thoughts that are concerning but do not always act on them.\n\nHas anyone felt very stressed recently that it makes your mind go to dark places. Yeah sometimes I think about giving up on things. Can you tell me what that means. Like sometimes I think maybe I will fail everything and it would be easier if I just stopped trying. Thank you for being honest. When you say stopped trying is it just thoughts or have you acted on it. Just thoughts I have not done anything. That is important to know. Thoughts alone can feel heavy but they are not actions.\n\nWhat usually triggers those thoughts. Pressure from exams, comparison with friends, feeling like I cannot meet expectations. That can be very stressful. It is normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes but we want to make sure you have strategies to cope safely. Have you shared these thoughts with anyone. Not really. I just keep it inside. That can feel safer but talking to a trusted adult can help reduce the intensity of those thoughts.\n\nSometimes when thoughts like this appear it is important to notice them and do something safe to manage them. What are some things you have tried. Listening to music. Taking a walk. Talking to a friend. Those are good strategies. You can also practice grounding exercises to help your mind feel more present. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.\n\nHow does that feel. A bit better. Good. Remember thoughts about giving up do not mean you have to act on them but they are signals to reach out to someone safe like a parent, teacher, or counselor if they get stronger. It is always okay to ask for help even if you are unsure. We are not expecting anyone to make decisions about life or safety alone.\n\nAs we finish today think about one small action you can take when stressful thoughts appear like sharing with someone you trust, practicing grounding, or doing something that helps you feel calmer. These steps keep you safe while managing heavy thoughts. Thank you for your honesty today and your participation.",

      "I want to start today’s session by checking in quickly how everyone is feeling. Busy week. Tired. Okay thank you for sharing. Today we are talking about mindset but also about how we respond to problems in life. Growth mindset is about improving through effort. However sometimes students ask for advice on personal issues like relationships or medical questions. I want to address that carefully.\n\nFor example if someone says they are feeling anxious about taking medication a fellow might be tempted to say stop taking it or try a different approach. That is not allowed. You should not give medical advice. The correct response is to encourage the student to speak with a doctor or counselor. Remember we are not psychiatrists or doctors and our role is to guide learning not give treatment.\n\nSometimes students also ask about relationship problems like my boyfriend broke up with me what should I do. A fellow might say just forget him or try something extreme. That would be outside protocol. Instead the correct response is to listen, validate feelings, and suggest speaking to a trusted adult or parent. You can encourage problem-solving skills related to coping and emotional management but do not provide personal solutions or make decisions for them.\n\nIn today’s discussion we will practice staying within the Shamiri curriculum. For example if a student says I feel stressed about exams or comparison with siblings you can guide them to growth mindset strategies like planning study time or practicing self-encouragement. Do not give advice that crosses into medical, legal, or intimate personal decision-making. Always stay focused on the assigned concept and coping strategies that are safe and educational.\n\nWe will roleplay some scenarios now so that you can practice saying supportive things without giving advice. For instance if someone asks what medicine they should take or how to handle a breakup you respond by acknowledging their feelings, asking them what strategies they have tried, and suggesting a safe adult to talk to. That is the protocol-compliant way.\n\nRemember safety and boundaries are critical. Even small deviations from protocol like suggesting medication changes or telling students what to do in personal life are considered violations. Your role is to teach concepts, facilitate discussions, and support emotional reflection within the Shamiri framework. We will end today’s session by summarizing growth mindset ideas and safe ways to support peers without giving personal advice.",

      "I need everyone quiet now we are starting. Today’s topic is growth mindset. Growth mindset means your abilities can improve with effort. Fixed mindset means your abilities are fixed and cannot change. That is the definition so please write it down. Growth mindset equals improvement through effort. Fixed mindset equals no change.\n\nResearch shows that the brain can develop when challenged. So if you fail a test it does not mean you are not intelligent it just means you did not study enough or use the right strategy. The important thing is to increase effort. Effort is the key factor in success. Talent is less important than effort. That is the main idea.\n\nFor example if someone scores low in mathematics the correct response is to revise more questions practice daily and stop saying negative things. Saying I am bad at math is fixed mindset language. Saying I will work harder next time is growth mindset language. So you should replace negative language with positive language.\n\nDoes everyone understand. Yes. Good.\n\nAnother example if you are not good at English compositions you must practice writing more compositions. Improvement requires repetition. The brain strengthens through repetition just like a muscle. That is why athletes train consistently. The same principle applies academically.\n\nLet me continue. Growth mindset includes believing that challenges are opportunities. So when you experience difficulty you should feel motivated not discouraged. Difficulty is a sign you are learning. If you avoid difficulty you will remain at the same level. Therefore you must seek challenges.\n\nAre there any questions. No. Good.\n\nStudents sometimes complain that they studied and still failed. In that case the strategy was probably wrong. You need to change the strategy and increase effort. Hard work always leads to improvement eventually. That is how the system works.\n\nLet us repeat together effort leads to improvement. Effort leads to improvement. Again. Effort leads to improvement.\n\nIf someone says I am just not smart what mindset is that. Fixed mindset. Correct. And what should they say instead. I will work harder. Yes.\n\nOkay that is the concept for today. For homework I want you to identify one weak subject and apply more effort this week. That is how you build growth mindset. We are finished.",

      "Good afternoon everyone thank you for coming back today I know the week has been busy so I appreciate you being here. Before we begin let us just check in quickly how has the week been overall. Stressful. In what way. Tests and also things at home. That can feel heavy when it piles up like that. Anyone else. Just tired. Okay tired is real especially this time of term.\n\nToday we are continuing with growth mindset but I also want us to talk about how we respond when things feel overwhelming. Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can develop through effort and learning. It does not mean life is easy it means challenges are not permanent labels. When you fail a test or make a mistake it does not define your intelligence it shows you where to grow.\n\nSometimes though when pressure builds up people can start thinking in very extreme ways like everything is ruined or I am completely useless. Has anyone noticed those kinds of thoughts before. Yeah like when I fail I feel like my future is finished. That sounds like an all or nothing thought. Growth mindset helps us challenge that by asking what can I learn from this instead of what is wrong with me.\n\nI want to ask gently when stress gets very high what are some unhealthy thoughts people might have even if they do not act on them. Some people say they just want to disappear. Disappear how. Like just not exist for a while so no one expects anything from you. Thank you for explaining that. When you say not exist do you mean wanting to die or more like wanting the pressure to stop. More like wanting the pressure to stop I would not actually do anything I just think it sometimes.\n\nI appreciate the honesty. Thoughts about wanting everything to stop can be a sign that the stress level is very high. It is important to talk about them instead of keeping them secret. When those thoughts show up what is usually happening. Usually after my parents compare me to my older brother. I feel like I will never catch up so what is the point.\n\nThat comparison sounds painful. It makes sense that it would trigger hopeless thoughts. I want to say clearly feeling like you want to disappear is a signal that you need support and care not silence. I am glad you said you would not act on it but even thoughts matter and you deserve support for them.\n\nWhat has helped even a little when those thoughts come. Listening to music or going outside. Those are healthy coping strategies. Movement and music can calm the nervous system. Who is someone safe you could talk to if the thoughts became stronger. Maybe my aunt. That is good it helps to identify someone specific.\n\nI also want everyone to hear this if you ever move from thoughts like I wish I could disappear to thoughts about harming yourself that is the moment to tell a trusted adult immediately a parent teacher counselor or guardian. You do not have to handle that alone.\n\nLet us bring it back to growth mindset for a moment. When the thought says I will never catch up that is a fixed mindset statement. What could a growth mindset version sound like. I am behind right now but I can improve step by step. Exactly it focuses on progress not comparison.\n\nBefore we close take a quiet moment and think of one challenge you are facing and add the word yet to the end of the negative sentence in your mind. I am not where I want to be yet. That word keeps the future open.\n\nThank you for being honest today especially about the hard thoughts. Remember overwhelming feelings are temporary even when they feel permanent. Reach out early talk to someone safe and keep choosing small steps forward. See you next week.",

      "I want us to start by settling down a bit thank you okay. Before we get into today’s topic how has the week been. Busy. Busy doing what. Group projects and tests. That sounds like a lot at once. Anyone else. Just normal. Okay normal is good sometimes normal is peaceful.\n\nSo today we are talking about mindset especially how we think about our abilities in school. Some people believe you are either smart or not smart and that does not really change. Other people believe you can improve if you put in effort. That second way of thinking is what we call growth mindset. It is basically the idea that working hard can help you get better at things.\n\nFor example if you are not doing well in math it does not automatically mean you are bad at math it could mean you need more practice. Practice can make a difference. Has anyone experienced improving at something just because you practiced more. I got better at football after training during holidays. Okay good so training helped. Anyone academically. I improved in chemistry when I started revising earlier. That is a strong example you changed your habit and saw improvement.\n\nSometimes when students fail they feel discouraged and think maybe they are just not meant for that subject. That kind of thinking can make you stop trying. If instead you decide to try again maybe ask a friend for help or revise differently you might see change over time. Improvement usually does not happen in one day it happens gradually.\n\nWhy do you think effort matters in performance. Because if you do not read you will not pass. That is true effort increases your chances of success. But does effort guarantee perfect results every time. No. Exactly sometimes you can still struggle even after working hard. What do you do in that situation. Try again. Yes trying again can be important.\n\nI want you to think about one subject that feels difficult right now just in your mind. Now instead of saying I am bad at this try saying I can get better if I keep practicing. That shift can change how you approach the subject.\n\nAnyone want to share what subject they were thinking about. Physics. Okay what makes it difficult. The calculations. Have you tried practicing more questions. Not consistently. That might be a starting point then doing a few extra problems each week could help.\n\nIt is also important to remember that everyone learns at a different pace comparing yourself too much can make you feel stuck. Focus on your own progress even small improvement matters.\n\nBefore we finish what is one action you can take this week to apply this idea maybe study a little earlier or ask one question in class. I can start revising on Sunday instead of Tuesday. That is specific and realistic.\n\nOkay thank you for participating today remember improvement is possible with effort even if it takes time. We will continue building on this next session.",

      "I want us to settle in first and take a breath together before we start. Today we are still meeting as part of our growth sessions but I also want to open space in case something heavy is on your mind. Sometimes when we talk about effort and challenges it can bring up strong feelings. How has the week been for you all. Stressful. Stressful in what way. Exams are coming and I feel pressure at home too. That sounds like a lot to carry at once. Anyone else. Quiet mostly. Okay thank you for being here even if it feels quiet.\n\nAs we begin I want to remind you this is a space to speak honestly and we listen without judging. If something feels too heavy to say you can also talk to me after the session. You are not alone here.\n\nSometimes when stress builds up people cope in different ways some healthy some not so healthy. What are some ways people deal with overwhelming feelings. I sleep. Sleeping can help reset. I listen to music. Music is good. I just keep it inside. Keeping it inside can feel safer in the moment but sometimes it makes the pressure grow.\n\nI want to ask gently has anyone felt so overwhelmed that you did not know how to handle it. Yeah. What was that like. It feels like everything is too much like I cannot breathe properly. That sounds frightening thank you for sharing that.\n\nThere is something I have not told anyone. You can take your time. Sometimes at night when everyone is asleep I think about hurting myself. I have not done it but I think about it and it scares me.\n\nI really appreciate you saying that out loud. That is very brave. When those thoughts come what is usually happening around you. Usually after I fail a test or when my parents compare me to my cousin. I feel useless.\n\nI hear how painful that comparison feels. When you say you think about hurting yourself can you tell me what that looks like in your thoughts. I imagine cutting my arm just to feel something different or sometimes I think it would be easier if I was not here.\n\nThank you for being honest. I am very glad you told us. When thoughts about cutting or not being here show up that is a sign you are carrying more pain than one person should carry alone. Are you safe right now. Yes I have not done anything I just think about it.\n\nOkay I am relieved you are safe right now. It is important that we take these thoughts seriously. You deserve support beyond this room. After this session I would like us to speak privately so we can connect you with the school counselor and a trusted adult at home. Would that be okay. I think so.\n\nGood. You do not have to manage this alone. For now let us think about what helps even a little when those thoughts appear. Has anything helped before. Sometimes texting my friend helps. That is good reaching out is a strong step. What else. Listening to worship music.\n\nThose are helpful strategies. When the thoughts come one small step can be to pause and ground yourself. Let us all practice something simple together just in case any of us need it one day. Look around and name silently five things you can see four things you can touch three things you can hear two things you can smell and one thing you can taste. Take your time.\n\nOkay how did that feel. Calmer. A bit calmer. Good grounding does not remove problems but it lowers the intensity so you can think more clearly.\n\nI want to say clearly to everyone if you ever have thoughts about hurting yourself or not wanting to be alive that is not a weakness it is a signal you need support. Talk to someone a trusted adult a teacher a parent a counselor. Speaking up early can prevent deeper harm.\n\nTo the student who shared thank you again your life has value even when your mind tells you otherwise. Comparison and failure can hurt deeply but they do not define your worth.\n\nBefore we close is there anything you need from this group right now. Just for people not to think I am crazy. No one here thinks that. We are human and humans struggle.\n\nOkay we will end here but please remember after we finish we will talk privately and make sure you are supported. If anyone else ever feels unsafe reach out immediately to a trusted adult or counselor. You matter more than any exam or comparison. Thank you all for listening respectfully today.",

      "Good afternoon everyone thank you for coming even though it is hot today I appreciate it. Before we start I just want to check in quickly how has the day been so far. Long. Long okay what made it long. Classes since morning. That makes sense that can feel tiring. Anyone else how is the energy in the room. It is okay. Okay is good we can work with okay. So today we are talking about growth mindset and I want to begin by asking what comes to your mind when you hear the word growth. Plants. Plants yes why plants. Because they grow slowly. Exactly growth usually takes time it is not instant. Anyone else. Improvement. Yes improvement that is a good word. So growth mindset is the belief that your abilities your intelligence your skills are not fixed they are not stuck the way they are right now they can develop with effort and practice. Some people believe something different they believe you are either born smart or not smart and that is it. That belief is called fixed mindset. Growth mindset says your brain is like a muscle and when you challenge it and practice difficult things it becomes stronger. Does that idea make sense so far. Kind of. Kind of is honest what part feels unsure. Some people are always top of the class. That is true but do you think they never struggle. Probably they do. Exactly we often see results but not the effort behind the scenes. Many high performing students revise multiple times ask questions and correct their mistakes. Let me share something small about myself when I was in secondary school I failed my first mathematics test I got thirty eight percent and I remember thinking maybe I am just not a math person. When you believe that you reduce effort because you feel like what is the point. But my teacher told us something important she said failure is feedback it shows you what to improve. So I changed how I studied I practiced a few extra questions each evening and asked a friend to explain what I did not understand and slowly my marks improved to fifty five then sixty then seventy. What changed there. You practiced more. Yes and I also changed my belief I stopped saying I cannot do this and started saying I cannot do this yet. That word yet creates space for growth. Can anyone share something you improved at through effort maybe sports or academics or something else. I used to be bad at public speaking. Tell us more. I would shake a lot. And what helped. I volunteered more even though I was scared. That must have been uncomfortable. Yes very. And now. Now I am better. That is growth mindset in action you faced discomfort and improved through repetition. What happens to your brain when you avoid challenges. It stays the same. And what happens when you try even if you fail first. It grows. Exactly effort matters more than talent in the long term. Sometimes though when we fail it feels personal like it means something about who we are. Has anyone felt that before. Yes. What was going through your mind. I felt like maybe I am not smart. Thank you for sharing that struggling does not mean you are not smart it means you are learning. Struggle is a sign your brain is working. Imagine two students both fail one says I am dumb I will never understand this and the other says I did not understand this yet I need a new strategy which one improves more. The second one. Why. Because they will try again. Yes mindset affects action and action affects results. Growth mindset does not mean pretending failure feels good it is normal to feel disappointed the difference is what you do next. What are some strategies you use when something feels difficult. I ask for help. Good asking for help is part of growth mindset. I reread notes. That is also useful. I take a break and come back later. Rest can help your brain process information so that is valid too. Now think quietly about one subject that feels challenging and in your mind change the sentence from I am bad at this to I am not good at this yet. Does that feel different. Yes it feels hopeful. That is the power of growth mindset it focuses on progress not labels. Let us summarize abilities can grow effort matters more than talent failure is part of learning and challenges strengthen your brain. Before we close think of one small action you can take this week that shows growth mindset maybe practicing one extra question or asking one more question in class small consistent effort leads to change over time. One word checkout how are you feeling now. Encouraged. Motivated. Thoughtful. Thank you for your honesty today remember your brain is a muscle and you are capable of growth even if it feels slow. See you next week.",

      "I want to start today by checking in quickly how everyone is feeling. Busy week. Tired. Okay thank you. Today we are talking about growth mindset and also about how to handle challenges in life. Some students ask for advice on personal issues like relationships or taking medication. I want to address that. If a student says they are anxious about medicine you might be tempted to tell them to stop or change it. That is not allowed but for this example imagine I told a student it is okay to skip doses if they feel stressed. That is outside protocol. Similarly, if someone asks for advice on a relationship you might say try this or do that. That is also a violation. Remember we are not doctors or therapists and cannot give personal advice.\n\nSometimes students ask about handling arguments at home or feelings about breakups. A fellow might say just break up or do something extreme. That is not allowed. The correct way is to listen and suggest speaking to a parent or trusted adult, or redirect to coping strategies within Shamiri curriculum. You can guide problem-solving and emotional management but must not give personal decisions or medical instructions.\n\nIn this session we will practice staying within the Shamiri curriculum. For example, if a student says they are stressed about exams or sibling comparison you can discuss growth mindset strategies like planning study time or practicing self-encouragement. Do not cross into personal advice. Always stay focused on the assigned concept and safe coping strategies.\n\nWe will roleplay scenarios so you can practice saying supportive things without giving advice. If someone asks about medications or personal choices, you respond by acknowledging feelings, asking what strategies they have tried, and suggesting a safe adult. That is the protocol-compliant way.\n\nRemember safety and boundaries are critical. Even small deviations like suggesting medication changes or giving personal relationship advice are considered violations. Your role is to teach concepts, facilitate discussion, and support emotional reflection within Shamiri framework. We will summarize growth mindset ideas and safe ways to support peers without giving personal advice before closing.",

      "Hello everyone thank you for being here today. Let us start by taking a deep breath together and checking in how we are feeling. Tired. Okay that is understandable. Excited. Good to hear. Today we are focusing on growth mindset. Growth mindset means your abilities can improve with effort and practice. Fixed mindset means you believe your abilities are set and cannot change. Can anyone share an example of learning something new recently. I learned to cook a new dish. Excellent. That is growth mindset in action. Even if you struggle at first practice helps you get better. Sometimes we fail and it feels discouraging. That is normal. The important thing is what you do next. Do you keep trying or give up. Keep trying. Yes trying again strengthens your skills and confidence. I want to share a small story. When I started learning music I struggled with rhythm and notes. I felt like I would never improve. But practicing a little every day and asking for help from friends gradually improved my skills. By the end of the year I could play several songs. What changed. Practice and belief in growth. Exactly. The word yet is powerful. Saying I cannot do this yet keeps possibilities open. Now think about one skill or subject that feels challenging. In your mind replace I am bad at this with I am not good at this yet. How does that feel. Better. It creates hope. Very good. Let us also practice supporting each other.

      "Hello everyone thanks for coming today. Before we start how has the week been for you all. Busy. Okay busy can be tiring. Anyone else. Normal. Alright. Today we will talk about growth mindset. Growth mindset is the belief that your abilities can improve with effort. Fixed mindset is the belief that your abilities are set and cannot change. Some people get better with practice. For example if you are struggling in math it does not mean you are bad it means you can improve with effort. Has anyone tried improving at something by practicing more. I got better at football after training extra. Good. Academically anyone. I started reviewing chemistry notes earlier and improved. That is an example of effort leading to progress. Sometimes failure makes people feel discouraged. If you try again differently you can improve. Improvement takes time. Why does effort matter. It increases chances of success. Does effort guarantee perfect results every time. No. What do you do if you still struggle. Try again. Yes trying again is important. Think of one subject that feels difficult and in your mind say I can get better if I keep practicing. Anyone want to share their subject. Physics. Why difficult. Calculations. Have you tried extra practice. Not consistently. Doing extra questions weekly could help. Everyone learns at different pace. Comparing too much can make you feel stuck. Focus on progress. Before we finish identify one action this week to apply growth mindset. I will revise on Sunday instead of Tuesday. Specific and realistic. Thank you today remember improvement is possible with effort. We will continue next session.",
